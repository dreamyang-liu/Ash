"""The rollback stack's acceptance test, against a real AgentENV.

Everything else about forking is covered with fakes. This is the one test that
answers the question the fakes cannot: **does branching actually isolate?** The
first fork demo, run on Docker (which cannot snapshot), showed exactly the failure
this prevents -- branch 1 edited a file and branch 2, sharing the filesystem,
reported "the file no longer contains the bug".

Skipped unless AENV_SERVER_URL is reachable and the ash-runtime binary is built,
so a normal test run is unaffected. Each test creates and destroys its own
sandboxes and never touches anything it did not make: a shared AgentENV is likely
to be hosting somebody's long-running task.
